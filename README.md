## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the University of Montreal and consists of Chest X-ray images categorized into test and train sets. Each set further branches into three classes representing different conditions related to COVID-19 detection:

## Methodology
In this project, we employed the EfficientNet B1 deep learning model for COVID-19 detection. EfficientNet B1 is a convolutional neural network architecture known for its efficiency and effectiveness in image classification tasks, making it suitable for analyzing Chest X-ray images and detecting COVID-19 cases.
