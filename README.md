# COVID-19 Detection via Deep Learning

## Overview
This project aims to contribute to the improvement of COVID-19 detection using Chest X-rays through the implementation of deep learning techniques. By leveraging deep learning models, particularly using PyTorch, this project seeks to assist medical professionals and researchers in diagnosing COVID-19 cases more accurately and efficiently.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the University of Montreal and consists of Chest X-ray images categorized into test and train sets. Each set further branches into three classes representing different conditions related to COVID-19 detection.

### Directory Structure
- **test/**
  - **class1/**: Contains X-ray images belonging to class 1.
  - **class2/**: Contains X-ray images belonging to class 2.
  - **class3/**: Contains X-ray images belonging to class 3.

- **train/**
  - **class1/**: Contains X-ray images belonging to class 1.
  - **class2/**: Contains X-ray images belonging to class 2.
  - **class3/**: Contains X-ray images belonging to class 3.

## Acknowledgements
We would like to express our gratitude to the University of Montreal for providing access to the Chest X-ray dataset, enabling us to undertake this research project.

## Inspiration
This project is driven by the desire to contribute to the medical and research community's efforts in combating the COVID-19 pandemic. By sharing our work and encouraging collaboration, we hope to facilitate advancements in COVID-19 detection methodologies and ultimately contribute to the global fight against the virus.
